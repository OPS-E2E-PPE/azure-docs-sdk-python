        be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value

        from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic

        Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

        request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an

        ''invalid property value'' error response. If you do not specify this

        element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an

        error if the current value is terminatejob. Possible values include:
