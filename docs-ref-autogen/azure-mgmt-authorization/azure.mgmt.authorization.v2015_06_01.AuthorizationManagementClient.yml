  summary: Role based access control provides you a way to apply granular level policy
    administration down to individual resources or resource groups. These operations
    enable you to manage role definitions and role assignments. A role definition
    describes the set of actions that can be performed on resources. A role assignment
    grants access to Azure Active Directory users.
