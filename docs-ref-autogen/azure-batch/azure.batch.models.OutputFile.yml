  summary: 'A specification for uploading files from an Azure Batch Compute Node to

    another location after the Batch service has finished executing the Task

    process.


    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

    parameters:
    - description: 'Required. A pattern indicating which file(s) to

        upload. Both relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are

        relative to the Task working directory. The following wildcards are

        supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would

        match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single

        character, [abc] matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches

        one character in the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any

        character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a,

        b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may

        be matched by specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match

        .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A simple example: >>**<<*.txt matches any file

        that does not start in ''.'' and ends with .txt in the Task working

        directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard

        character it can be escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match

        a file named abc*). Note that both and / are treated as directory

        separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux. Environment variables

        (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern

        being applied.'
