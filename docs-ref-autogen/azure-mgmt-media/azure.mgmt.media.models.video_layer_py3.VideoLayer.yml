summary: 'Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a

  desired output bitrate layer.

  sub-classes are: H264Layer

      integers (For example, 30000/1001), or in the form of a number (For

      example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints on allowed frame
