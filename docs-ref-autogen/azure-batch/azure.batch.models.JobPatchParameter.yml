        -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the

        termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

        request fails with an ''invalid property value'' error response; if you are

        calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

        poolInfo, only the keepAlive property of the autoPoolSpecification can be

        updated, and then only if the autoPoolSpecification has a

        poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job properties can be updated as normal).
