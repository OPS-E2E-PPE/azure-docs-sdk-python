    description: "An exchangeable phrase list feature are serves as\nsingle feature\

      \ feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a\ngiven word or 0 if\
      \ it doesn\u2019t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms\nlist. A non-exchangeable\
      \ phrase list feature has all the phrases in the\nlist serve as separate features\
      \ to the underlying training algorithm. So,\nif you your phrase list feature\
      \ contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to\n5 separate features. You can think\
      \ of the non-exchangeable phrase list\nfeature as an additional bag of words\
      \ that you are willing to add to LUIS\nexisting vocabulary features. Think of\
      \ a non-exchangeable as set of\ndifferent words. Default value is true. Default\
