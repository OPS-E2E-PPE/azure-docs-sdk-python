  summary: 'Provides the home for all of the configurable policies in the pipeline.


    A new Configuration object provides no default policies and does not specify in
    what

    order the policies will be added to the pipeline. The SDK developer must specify
    each

    of the policy defaults as required by the service and use the policies in the

    Configuration to construct the pipeline correctly, as well as inserting any

    unexposed/non-configurable policies.'
