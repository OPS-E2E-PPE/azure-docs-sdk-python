        scheduling other Tasks in the Job. The Job Manager Task''s typical purpose

        is to control and/or monitor Job execution, for example by deciding what

        additional Tasks to run, determining when the work is complete, etc.

        (However, a Job Manager Task is not restricted to these activities - it is

        a fully-fledged Task in the system and perform whatever actions are

        required for the Job.) For example, a Job Manager Task might download a

        file specified as a parameter, analyze the contents of that file and
