        -Invalid - Indicates the replica status is invalid. All Service Fabric

        enumerations have the invalid type. The value is zero.

        -InBuild - The replica is being built. This means that a primary replica

        is seeding this replica. The value is 1.

        -Standby - The replica is in standby. The value is 2.

        -Ready - The replica is ready. The value is 3.

        -Down - The replica is down. The value is 4.

        -Dropped - Replica is dropped. This means that the replica has been

        removed from the replica set. If it is persisted, its state has been

        deleted. The value is 5.
