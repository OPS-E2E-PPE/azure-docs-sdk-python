    - description: 'The maximum elapsed time that the Job may run,

        measured from the time the Job is created. If the Job does not complete

        within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any Tasks that

        are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be

        MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no

    - description: 'The maximum number of times each Task may be

        retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero.

        Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The

        Batch service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this

        limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up

        to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is

        0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is

        -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0

        (no retries).'
