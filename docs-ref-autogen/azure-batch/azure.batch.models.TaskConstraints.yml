  summary: Execution constraints to apply to a Task.
  syntax:
    content: 'TaskConstraints(*, max_wall_clock_time=None, retention_time=None, max_task_retry_count:
      int = None, **kwargs) -> None'
    parameters:
    - description: 'The maximum elapsed time that the Task may

        run, measured from the time the Task starts. If the Task does not complete

        within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it. If this is not

        specified, there is no time limit on how long the Task may run.'

      type:
      - timedelta
    - description: 'The minimum time to retain the Task directory on

        the Compute Node where it ran, from the time it completes execution. After

        this time, the Batch service may delete the Task directory and all its

        contents. The default is 7 days, i.e. the Task directory will be retained

        for 7 days unless the Compute Node is removed or the Job is deleted.'

      type:
      - timedelta
    - description: 'The maximum number of times the Task may be

        retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero.

        Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the

        Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the

        Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the

        maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial

        try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service

        does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry

        count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit.'
