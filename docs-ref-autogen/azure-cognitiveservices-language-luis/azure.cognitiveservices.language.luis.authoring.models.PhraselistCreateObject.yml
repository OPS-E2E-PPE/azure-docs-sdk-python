    description: "An interchangeable phrase list feature serves as a\nlist of synonyms\

      \ they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You\ncan think of the non-interchangeable\
      \ phrase list as an additional bag of\nwords to add to LUIS existing vocabulary\
      \ features. It is used as a lexicon\nlookup feature where its value is 1 if\
      \ the lexicon contains a given word\nor 0 if it doesn\u2019t.  Default value\
      \ is true. Default value: True ."
