    - description: 'The maximum allowed percentage of

        unhealthy nodes before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of

        nodes to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.

        The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that

        can be unhealthy before the cluster is considered in error.

        If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node,

        the health is evaluated as Warning.

        The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes

        over the total number of nodes in the cluster.

        The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

        nodes. Default percentage is zero.

        In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so

        this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.

        If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
