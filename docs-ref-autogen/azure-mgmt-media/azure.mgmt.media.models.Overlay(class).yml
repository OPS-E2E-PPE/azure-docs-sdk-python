summary: 'Base type for all overlays - image, audio or video.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: AudioOverlay, VideoOverlay


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

  parameters:
  - name: input_label
    description: 'The label of the job input which is to be used as an

      overlay. The Input must specify exactly one file. You can specify an image

      file in JPG or PNG formats, or an audio file (such as a WAV, MP3, WMA or

      M4A file), or a video file. See [https://aka.ms/mesformats](https://aka.ms/mesformats)

  - name: start
    description: 'The start position, with reference to the input video, at

      which the overlay starts. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. For

      example, PT05S to start the overlay at 5 seconds in to the input video. If

      not specified the overlay starts from the beginning of the input video.'

      value should be in ISO 8601 duration format. For example, PT30S to end the

      will be applied until the end of the input video if inputLoop is true.

    description: 'The duration over which the overlay fades out of
